# Technology Stack

## Version Control
- **JJ (Jujutsu):** The project uses JJ for version control.

## Static Site Generator
- **Jekyll (GitHub Pages flavor):** The project uses Jekyll configured specifically for GitHub Pages but explicitly **disables default themes and plugins** to ensure a dependency-free, minimalist setup. This means the `_site` directory should not be committed, as GitHub handles the build process automatically.

## Hosting
- **GitHub Pages:** The blog is hosted on GitHub Pages, leveraging its native integration with Jekyll.
